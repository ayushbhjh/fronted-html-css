<h2>What is carbon compunds?</h2>

<p>
    Carbon is very reactive. It forms a huge number of compounds with many other elements. Compounds containing carbon
    outnumber the compounds of all the other elements

<p>
    Carbon is known to form a number of compounds due to the salient properties it carries with itself. The most general
    or the <strong><i>basic compound formed by carbon is methane (CH<sub>4</sub>).</i></strong> types of compounds
    formed
    by the combination of hydrogen and carbon are known as hydrocarbons. You can easily guess the molecular formula of
    such type of compounds by just adding hydrogen to satisfy the valency of carbon atoms.

    Ethane which has two carbon atoms will need 6 hydrogen atoms to satisfy the valency of each carbon atom (keeping in
    mind the single bond existing between both the carbon atoms). Hence, the molecular formula for ethane is
    C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. Now, the bond between two or more carbon atoms involved in the formation of a compound
    can be single, double or even a triple bond.Thus, on the basis of the number of bonds existing between the C-atoms
    involved in the formation of a compound we classify carbon compounds into two major categories: <strong>saturated
        and unsaturated carbon compounds.</strong>

<h3>Types of Carbon Compounds</h3><br>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Saturated Carbon Compounds <br>
        <p>These are the compounds in which various carbon atoms in a chain or a ring are linked together by single
            bonds only. Alkanes are the most common examples of saturated chain carbon compounds. Ethane is a member of
            the alkane family whose structure is drawn below:</p>

    <h1>What is CSS </h1>
    <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and
        formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally
        used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML
        documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.

            <p>Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process. For example: If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will be become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. It was a W3C recommendation.</p>
